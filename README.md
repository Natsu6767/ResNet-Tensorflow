# Implementation of ResNet

Beside the comments in the code itself, I also wrote an article 
which you can find [here](https://mohitjain.me/2018/06/13/resnet/) with further explanations on ResNet.

## Content

- `resnet.py`: Implementation of the resnet architecture.
- `residual.py`: Implementation of a single residual block.
- `ResNet Train.ipynb`: Notebook to train the implementation of ResNet.
- `layers`: Contains files implementing basic layers [convolutions, max pooling and fully connected].
